Step1:     Start
Step 2:    Accept the three subject marks for each student
Step 3:     Set sub= 3  
Step 4:     Sum of subject=  A+B+C
Step 5:     Avrage = Sum of subject / sub
Step 6:.    Set std = 3 
Step 7:.    Sum of Sub A=A+A+A
Step 8:     Avrage =Sum of Sub A/std
Step 9:     Sum of Sub B=B+B+B
Step 10:   Avrage =Sum of Sub B/std
Step 11:   Sum of Sub C=C+C+C2
Step 12:   Avrage =Sum of Sub C/std
Step 13:   End
